To improve the performance of the multiplier, Booth multiplier is mostly used. 
The number of partial product rows that must be added to give the multiplication‟s result can be reduced by using Booth decoding. 

The Booth Radix-4 algorithm reduces the number of partial products by half while keeping the circuit’s complexity down to a minimum. 
This results in lower power operation in an FPGA and provides for multiplication when no hard multipliers are otherwise available. 
Booth Recoding makes these advantages possible by skipping clock cycles that add nothing new in the way of product terms. 
The Radix-4 Booth Recoding is simply a multiplexer that selects the correct shift-and-add operation based on the groupings of bits found in the product register. 
The product register holds the multiplier. The multiplicand and the two’s complement of the multiplicand are added based on the recording value.

The following project shows the following :

-Full listing of the verilog program.
-Test bench to show the design.
-Output waveforms achieved from simulation.

The following is a brief explanation of the main code that multiplies the 8-bit inputs(x and y).

1)The main module (multi) consist of seven ports (2 inputs and 5 output). 

2)The module consist of three registers of  different sizes.

    i.Size 3, to store the three bits that were encoded from the multiplier. 
    
    ii.Size 8, stores the partial products generated by the the booth’s criterion. 
    
Booth’s criterion from the three bits taken from the  multiplier input y using the radix-4 method:

000,111→ previous product +  zero.

001,010→ previous product + multiplicand.

011→ previous product + multiplicand shifted to the left by 1 bit.

100→ previous product + 2’s complement of the multiplicand shifted to the left by 1 bit.

101,110→ previous product +  2’s complement of multiplicand.

Size 16, to store the signed partial products.
The partial products, starting from the second one, were shifted to the left by 2 bits due to the radix 4 operation. 
The partial products were added by the carry-look-ahead adder defined by 16-bit adder module called cladder in the program.
The final product was passed to the 5-digit converter module via the output port.
