Multiplication is one of the most important and basic arithmetic operations that constitute programs. Multiplication is achieved by the addition of a certain number of partial product rows. 
Each partial product row is generated by multiplying the multiplier bit one by one to multiplicand. In a simple multiplier, the generated partial product rows are equal to the number of bits in the multiplier.

An 8-bit by 8-bit multiplier is a component commonly found in Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) and is used for multiplying two 8-bit binary numbers. 
An Arithmetic Logic Unit is a fundamental component of a central processing unit (CPU) that performs arithmetic and logical operations on binary numbers.

Here's how an 8-bit by 8-bit multiplier generally works:

Inputs:

Two 8-bit binary numbers (operands) designated as multiplicand and multiplier.
Multiplication Process:

The multiplier bits are examined one by one, starting from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
For each bit in the multiplier, if the bit is 1, the multiplicand is added to a running sum. If the bit is 0, no addition is performed.
The multiplicand is left-shifted by one position (multiplied by 2) for each bit position.
Accumulation:

The results of each partial multiplication are accumulated to obtain the final product.
Carry Management:
During the addition of partial products, carry bits may be generated.
These carries need to be properly managed to ensure accurate results.
The process is similar to how we perform multiplication manually, where we multiply each digit of one number with each digit of the other and sum the results.
In binary, the multiplication process is simpler since the partial products are either 0 or a shifted version of the multiplicand.

The 8-bit by 8-bit multiplier is designed to handle 8-bit inputs, and the result can be a 16-bit number (or more, depending on the design).
The result can be stored in a register or memory for further processing or output.

It's important to note that the implementation details can vary based on the specific design and requirements of the ALU or the processor. 
Modern processors may use more advanced techniques, such as parallelism, pipelining, and optimized algorithms, to perform multiplication efficiently.
