Arithmetic logic unit has always been a crucial part in every digital system. They are the core part
within all the types of processing any computer or digital-based system depends upon. Hence, the
Arithmetic Logic Unit, also known as the ALU, requires to be designed in a comprehensive and fully
functional manner. The project therefore aims to design an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit, in it’s full
operational form with all it’s basic functionality. The project gives a brief idea of the ALU system and how it
can be designed. It is then followed by the ALU design, which is designed with 16 different major
operational activities. The design is conducted using VHDL programming in Quartus II, and it’s functional
simulation is evaluated and tested using the functional diagram.


The entire system was created using VHDL coding. The following section describes the code flow and functions of each assignments.
(i) Library
Only one library, the IEEE library was called for supporting the port signals and data types.
Within the library, certain classes were called for declaring the standard logic vectors upon the
inputs, outputs and signals. All this bits were unsigned in our case. The classes included the


STD_LOGIC_1164,


STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED and NUMERIC_STD classes. 


(ii) Entity
The entity part of the code is a very important part as it defines and initializes all the ports, the constants and the variables to be used. There were three input ports in our case, two (A & B)
with 8-bit signal length and one (ALU_Sel) with 4-bit signal length. There is also two output port, in which one is an 8-bit signal length and the other is a single bit signal. The variable
defined in the generic, are the constants that will be used during the shift operations.


(iii) Architectural Behaviour
This part of the code is the most important part as it is where the main functionalism are written. The part will be described greatly by the use of the flowchart that will ease the
understanding of the overall process inside an ALU.

2.1 Overall ASM for the ALU design.
The Algorithm state machine chart is the fundamental approach in designing the system. The chart
describes the overall flow of the logic unit. Initially, two 8-bit values are storedupon two registers. As the
registers are detected with values, the control unit asserts aselection signal, in this case the ALU_select,
that selects the particular operations tobeperformed by the ALU upon the following values. The
ALU_select signal is the crucial control unit signal that makes the ALU perform the right job upon the
arrived data inputs.

The ALU has three main operation parts:
● Arithmetic - data values are operated using other systems such as full adders, multipliers and
dividers, to produce a valuable output, eg. Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.
● Logic Unit - data values are operated using basic logic gates as well as one systemstructure also
known as the comparator. Gates include, AND,NOR,NAND,OR,XOR,XNOR.
● Shift - data values are just shifted or rotated around to produce/performa desirabletask, using the
shift registers. Eg. Left Shift, Right Shift, Rotate Left/Right.
After all the data’s stored upon the registers are worked upon, the final output, whichis a8-bit value, is
stored upon the output port signal, known here as the Operation_out. Thereis an exception in the output for
the comparator logic units, as they change only the2least significant bits of the output, hence the rest of the
bits, till the MSB, is by default 0or don’t-care. On the other hand, the Carry_out, single-bit output is
generated bytheArithmetic Logic unit is used during addition and shifting/rotating only or also
usedtodetermine overflow in addition cases. It however, can be discarded in all the other cases.

each representing the 16 different operations performed by the ALU.

The figure above shows the ultimate chip-like structure of the ALU system. It shows all the inputs, outputs
and control signals upon the ALU system. The input and output ports are all connected to the system’s
internal bus that stores the data unto the registers. Theregisters then loads the data unto the operation
selected with the help of the input control signals that are shown as the operation select in the diagram. The
output of the operationis then moved into the output register and then exited upon the data path via the
output ports.

2.3.1 Modules Inside the Arithmetic Unit
(i) 8-Bit Full Adder/Subtractor
Figure 2.4 Adder/Subtractor
The following show the 8-bit Adder/Subtractor that consists of 8 full adder systems. The Sequential
arrangements of the full-adder circuits, is the most common form of adder system within an Arithmetic
unit. However, due to its time-consuming and slownature, this type of adders are being replaced by the
carry-look-ahead adders or other adder/subtractor designs. Over here, each full adder adds up the two
input bits and the carry-inbit to produce a sum output and a carry-out. The carry-out of one full-adder acts
as the carry in of the next adder.
(ii) 8-Bit Multiplier
The 8-bit Multiplier can be formed via various design systems. In this case, we will discuss the simplest
and the most common multiplier. The multiplier in this case is made using the adder circuit with the shift
register circuits. The

(iii) 8-Bit Divider
Figure 2.5 Shows the divider module for 8-bits(left) and 4bits(right) Divider circuits
can be made using various different circuit logic. The diagramaboveshows one such divider
circuit. It is a combination of subtractor systems, shift registersalong with 2-1 Multiplexers.
2.3.2 Modules Inside the Logic Unit
(i) Logic Gates
There were 8 gate of each type used within the logic unit. Each gate represent aparticular bit for the ALU
circuity. In total there were 48 logic gates used. There were6different logics to be controlled, that
included NOR, OR, AND, NAND, XORand XNOR.

Figure 2.6 Shows a 8-bit Equal Comparator Circuit.
The circuit is made of only 9 logic gates. 8 XNOR gates and a 8-input ANDgate. TheXNOR
gates compare the two bits, if they are the same, it output’s a 1 whilst a differencein them outputs
0. Hence, the AND gate output is 1, if only all the XNOR outputs equal 1.

The following represents the comparator built upon several different logic gates alongwith several 2-1
Multiplexers. The comparator starts with LSB, XOR-ing the two bits andoutputting as the input to the
selector of the multiplexer in the next bit comparison level.

Structure Module. The Module composes of 8 multiplexers, eachrepresenting for one bit of the
data result. Each Multiplexer is a 16-to-1 MUXthat usesthe 4 selector signals to select an
operation to pass through to the output.
