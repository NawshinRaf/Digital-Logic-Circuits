Arithmetic logic unit has always been a crucial part in every digital system. They are the core part
within all the types of processing any computer or digital-based system depends upon. Hence, the
Arithmetic Logic Unit, also known as the ALU, requires to be designed in a comprehensive and fully
functional manner. The project therefore aims to design an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit, in it’s full
operational form with all it’s basic functionality. The project gives a brief idea of the ALU system and how it
can be designed. It is then followed by the ALU design, which is designed with 16 different major
operational activities. The design is conducted using VHDL programming in Quartus II, and it’s functional
simulation is evaluated and tested using the functional diagram.
